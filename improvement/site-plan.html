      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I could be doing so much more, or I want to be doing so much more. When was the last time you had such thoughts? Did you end up taking action or did it become another passing thought? Count me guilty as charged… knowing myself and what improvements to make, its time to get to business. David Cottrell said, “When you write things down, you commit to doing them. If you simply tell me what you want to do, there is really no commitment to getting it done.” What better way to write it down then to digitalize it and take it to wherever you may be, no more excuses.</p>


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The target audience are those people that are sick and tired of not being able to do the things they want to do or think they could/should be doing. They feel as if they are lacking progress and improvement in their lives. They are usually aged from 20 to 40. These are people looking for direction. They could be college students packed with limitless possibilities, with many things pulling their attention and time in different directions. They could also be a single adult working and trying to get out there. Or they could even be a parent trying to support a young family. All wondering how they can do the things they want to do in order to progress. These people all have one thing in common which is thinking they don't have the time or don't know where to start to do the things they want to do. Access to the site will most often be through laptop or mobile device.</p>

        Typography
      </h3>
      For my heading font I chose Damion and for my paragraph font I chose Hind Madurai. I chose Damion as my heading font because I wanted to go for the feel like you were writing your goals down on a piece of paper. I then chose Hind Madurai because I thought it complimented the heading font that I chose.

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The purpose of this page is to track my own progress and to share that progress with the audience. It is a lot easier to connect to the audience when they feel like they can relate to you in some ways. A great way to do this is to state my own progression. This not only helps myself, but it also helps the audience that I am trying to reach. One of the biggest questions and worries in life is: What lies ahead of me? The future is one of our biggest what ifs. What do we want to do now in order to prepare for our future or what should we be doing now? Are we doing enough? I know for me, that this is something that is constantly weighing on my mind. Especially being a senior about to graduate with my bachelor’s degree. For me the future is something that I try to push off thinking about. I find that when I think about it, then I end up overwhelming myself. I find myself questioning if I am doing enough and if I am doing the things that I should be doing. It also makes me wonder what I should be doing. The world has many voices telling me what I should be doing and where I should be going. The voices around me from the people closest to me are always asking me, what’s next? It becomes awkward when I don’t know how to answer, because honestly I am not too sure myself.

      <h3>[Inspiration]</h3>
      <p>
        This page of my website will have quotes or short stories to help inspire the audience to really take action and accomplish the things they want to or need to accomplish. The main purpose of this page is to uplift and inspire the audience to take action for themselves. “Start small, think big. Don’t worry about too many things at once. Take a handful of simple things to begin with, and then progress to more complex ones. Think about not just tomorrow, but the future. Put a ding in the universe.” Steve Jobs “Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving.” Albert Einstein "Nothing is impossible. The word itself says: I'm possible!" Audrey Hepburn "Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So, sail away from the safe harbor. Explore. Dream. Discover." - Mark Twain "Every endeavor pursued with passion produces a successful outcome regardless of the result. For it is not about winning or losing. Rather the effort put forth into producing the outcome. The best way to predict the future is to create it." - Nick Bollettieri

      <h3>[Tips]</h3>
      <p>
        This page of my website will show tips from myself and from others that can help the audience to be able to do those things that they have wanted or needed to do but have just been putting off. The main purpose of this page is to give the audience ideas that they can implement in their own way in order for them to accomplish their own things in their own ways. This is just to help give them a starting point. Focus on one thing at a time. I know, I know this is something that is said over and over again, but it can really help you in the long run. Many times, we get so caught up in the many tasks that we need to get accomplished, that we become overwhelmed. When we become overwhelmed we start falling behind and pushing things off. This goes on and on, until we end up feeling like we are never able to accomplish the things that we want to or need to accomplish. It might be difficult at first, but by putting our focus on one thing at a time, we can focus our efforts and just get to work. When we focus and get to work we are able to accomplish so much more. Along with focusing on one thing at a time, break down big goals or tasks into smaller tasks. More often than not, we push things off or aren’t able to accomplish them because the task seems too daunting. By breaking big tasks up, we can see our progression towards completing the big task at hand and it all of a sudden becomes much more feasible. It’s like as we read in the scriptures, “…by small and simple things are great things brought to pass…” (Alma 37:6, Book of Mormon). Each small task, piece, or step brings us closer to our goal or destination.
