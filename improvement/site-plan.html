      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I could be doing so much more, or I want to be doing so much more. When was the last time you had such thoughts? Did you end up taking action or did it become another passing thought? Count me guilty as charged… knowing myself and what improvements to make, its time to get to business. David Cottrell said, “When you write things down, you commit to doing them. If you simply tell me what you want to do, there is really no commitment to getting it done.” What better way to write it down then to digitalize it and take it to wherever you may be, no more excuses.</p>


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The target audience are those people that are sick and tired of not being able to do the things they want to do or think they could/should be doing. They feel as if they are lacking progress and improvement in their lives. They are usually aged from 20 to 40. These are people looking for direction. They could be college students packed with limitless possibilities, with many things pulling their attention and time in different directions. They could also be a single adult working and trying to get out there. Or they could even be a parent trying to support a young family. All wondering how they can do the things they want to do in order to progress. These people all have one thing in common which is thinking they don't have the time or don't know where to start to do the things they want to do. Access to the site will most often be through laptop or mobile device.</p>

      <h3>
        Typography
      </h3>
      For my heading font I chose Damion and for my paragraph font I chose Hind Madurai. I chose Damion as my heading font because I wanted to go for the feel like you were writing your goals down on a piece of paper. I then chose Hind Madurai because I thought it complimented the heading font that I chose. 

      <h4>
        Heading Font: Damion
      </h4>
      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Hind Madurai
