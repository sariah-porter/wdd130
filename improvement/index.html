                <p>One of the biggest questions and worries in life is: What lies ahead of me? The future is one of our biggest what ifs. What do we want to do now in order to prepare for our future or what should we be doing now? Are we doing enough? Am I growing into the person that I am supposed to be? I know for me, that this is something that is constantly weighing on my mind. Especially being a senior about to graduate with my bachelor’s degree. For me the future is something that I try to push off thinking about. I find that when I think about it, then I end up overwhelming myself.</p>

                <p>The world has many voices telling me what I should be doing and where I should be going. The voices around me from the people closest to me are always asking me, what’s next? It becomes awkward when I don’t know how to answer, because honestly I am not too sure myself. Although, I am full of uncertainties. One thing I know is that I can only do what I can do right now, in this moment. Little by little I can make decisions that will help lead me to my own future.</p>
