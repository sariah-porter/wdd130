                <p>Focus on one thing at a time. I know, I know this is something that is said over and over again, but it can really help you in the long run. Many times, we get so caught up in the many tasks that we need to get accomplished, that we become overwhelmed. When we become overwhelmed we start falling behind and pushing things off. This goes on and on, until we end up feeling like we are never able to accomplish the things that we want to or need to accomplish. It might be difficult at first, but by putting our focus on one thing at a time, we can focus our efforts and just get to work. When we focus and get to work we are able to accomplish so much more.</p>

                <p>Along with focusing on one thing at a time, break down big goals or tasks into smaller tasks. More often than not, we push things off or aren’t able to accomplish them because the task seems too daunting. By breaking big tasks up, we can see our progression towards completing the big task at hand and it all of a sudden becomes much more feasible. It’s like as we read in the scriptures, “…by small and simple things are great things brought to pass…” (Alma 37:6, Book of Mormon). Each small task, piece, or step brings us closer to our goal or destination.</p>
